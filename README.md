## Introduction

The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a cutting-edge model that applies transformer architecture to image classification tasks. This project uses the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset and the `einops` library for image patching. The implementation covers image patching, patching images, model definition, and training.

## Setup and Dependencies

To run this project, you need to set up your environment and install the required dependencies. Key dependencies include:
- `einops` for image patching operations
- `tensorflow` or `torch` for model building and training
- `tensorflow_datasets` for loading the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset

## Dataset

The Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset is used for training the Vision Transformer. This dataset includes images of 37 different pet breeds, with approximately 200 images per breed. The dataset is split into training and validation sets for model evaluation.

## Image Patching

Image patching involves dividing each input image into smaller patches. These patches are then flattened and linearly embedded to be fed into the transformer model. The `einops` library simplifies the process of reshaping and reordering the image data.

### Steps:
1. **Load Images**: Load images from the dataset.
2. **Divide into Patches**: Split each image into fixed-size patches.
3. **Flatten Patches**: Flatten the patches to create a sequence of patch embeddings.

## Model

The Vision Transformer model consists of several key components:
- **Patch Embedding**: Converts image patches into a sequence of embeddings.
- **Transformer Encoder**: Processes the sequence of patch embeddings.
- **Classification Head**: Maps the encoder outputs to class probabilities.

The model is built using the chosen deep learning framework, and its architecture leverages the power of transformers for image classification.

## Training

The training process involves:
1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess the dataset and prepare it for training.
2. **Model Compilation**: Compile the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
3. **Training Loop**: Train the model on the training dataset and validate it on the validation set.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune as necessary.
